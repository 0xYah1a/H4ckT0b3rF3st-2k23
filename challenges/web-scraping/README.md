# Scrap Breast Cancer

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Scrap Breast Cancer" challenge as part of Hacktoberfest Pink October. In this challenge, we aim to gather and compile data related to breast cancer and its statistics from various online sources. By doing so, we can contribute to raising awareness about breast cancer and support research efforts to combat this disease.

## Main Goal

The main goal of this challenge is to collect data related to breast cancer, including statistics, research findings, and awareness resources. This data will be made publicly available to help researchers, healthcare professionals, and organizations working towards breast cancer prevention and treatment.

## Tools and Resources

To accomplish this challenge, you can use a variety of web scraping tools and resources, including:

- **Python**: A versatile programming language for web scraping.
- **Beautiful Soup: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
- **Scrapy**: A powerful web scraping framework for building web spiders.
- **Requests**: A Python library for making HTTP requests.
- **Selenium**: Useful for scraping websites that require user interaction.

## Guidelines

To participate in the "Scrap Breast Cancer" challenge, follow these guidelines:

1. Select a source or website with relevant breast cancer data. Ensure that you respect the website's terms of service and copyright policies.

2. Create a Python web scraping script to extract data from the chosen source. You can use any combination of the suggested tools, depending on the website's complexity.

You need to install Scrapy:
    
        pip install Scrapy

 Create a New Scrapy Project : 

        scrapy startproject breast_cancer_scraper


3. Document your code and include comments to make it understandable for other contributors.

## Contribution
