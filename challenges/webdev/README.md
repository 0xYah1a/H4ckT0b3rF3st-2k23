# Web Dev Challenges

## 1- Personal Portfolio Website
As a web developer, one of the most valuable assets you can have is a personal portfolio website. It's not just a showcase of your skills and accomplishments; it's your digital identity in the vast landscape of the web. Your challenge is to design and develop your very own personal portfolio website.

## 2- Classroom Template Website
In this challenge, your task is to design and develop a classroom (section) template website that can serve as a central hub for sharing links, resources, documents, and essential information for your classmates. The goal is to create a user-friendly and versatile template that can be customized and self-hosted by other classes within our university.
