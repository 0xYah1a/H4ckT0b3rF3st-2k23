* Just like us, TUX needs a place to call home, an environment where he can be himself. But the question is, what does TUX's world look like? Well, that's where your creativity comes in! It's time to imagine, create, and illustrate an environment that includes:
  + TUX: Our beloved penguin in the center of it all.
  + Some of his friends
  + A background: Show us where TUX and his pals are living their exciting adventures.
