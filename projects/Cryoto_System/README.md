# Crypto_System : 

Welcome to Crypto_System, an open-source project for cryptography enthusiasts who want to explore and implement cryptographic algorithms from scratch. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you can contribute to this project and dive into the world of cryptography.


## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to create a cryptographic system from the ground up. We aim to implement encryption and decryption functions for a wide range of cryptographic algorithms, both classic and modern. These algorithms are fundamental in ensuring data privacy and security.


# Challenges and Ideas

Looking for a challenge? Here are some ideas you can explore:

*   Optimize an existing algorithm implementation for better performance.
*   Add support for a new cryptographic algorithm.
*   Improve documentation to make it more accessible to newcomers.


# Supported Algorithms

for the first version of this project, we plan to implement a variety of cryptographic algorithms, including but not limited to:

### Foundational Functions

- **Hexadecimal / ASCII**
- **Base 16/32/64/85 Encoding and Decoding**
- **Byte Manipulation**
- **XOR Operation**

### Classic/Symmetric Algorithms

- **Caesar Cipher**
- **Vigenère Cipher**
- **Hill Cipher**
- **Substitution Cipher**
- **Playfair Cipher**
- **One-Time Pad**
- **ROT13**
- **Enigma Machine**
- **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**

### Asymmetric Algorithms

- **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)**
- **ElGamal Encryption**
- **Digital Signatures**

### Key Exchange Methods And Generation :

- **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE)**
- **RSA Key Pair Generation**
- **Public Key Distribution**

# Submission:

To facilitate the submission of algorithms with both code and descriptions, you can set up a directory structure for each algorithm with the following files ( exemple Cesar ):

    * Algorithm_Description_Caesar_Cipher.md (User submission for algorithm description)
    * Caesar_Cipher.py (Algorithm code for encryption)
    * Caesar_Cipher_decrypt.py (Algorithm code for decryption)

Here's an example structure for the "Caesar Cipher" algorithm:

    Main_Folder/
    ├── Caesar_Cipher/
    │   ├── Algorithm_Description_Caesar_Cipher.md
    │   ├── Caesar_Cipher.py
    │   └── Caesar_Cipher_decrypt.py
