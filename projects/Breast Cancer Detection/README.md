# Breast cancer :

Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.

# Challenges :
The key challenges against itâ€™s detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non cancerous). We ask you to complete the analysis of classifying these tumors using machine learning / Deep learning and Computer vision.

# Data Sets

We provide two datasets for this challenge, which can be accessed in the same repository:

1. **Breast Cancer Images Dataset**: This dataset contains a collection of images. You can access this dataset [Breast Cancer Images](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PbRbALop55smcBVJodjzH5Dh30AdHUYL/view?usp=drive_link).

2. **Breast Cancer  Data**: This dataset contains relevant clinical information about patients [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1twCSbVTlG4JIiawFU5YQQUfBasDPAEYr/view?usp=drive_link).
