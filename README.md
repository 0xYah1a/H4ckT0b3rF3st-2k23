By hosting Hacktoberfest 2023, OpenMinds Club strives to encourage everyone in contributing to free Open-Source projects as it has been, and will always remain our philosophy and fundamental goal.<br/> This repository is open to anyone and everyone who seeks to contribute in any project they've liked or discovered. As for the beginners, you are welcome to join our Hacktoberfest as well! Make sure you learn more about [open source](https://github.com/open-source).<br/><br/>
There is no contribution that is either too small or insignificant. However, every pull request has to, of course, follow some guidelines mentioned [here](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/). All of OpenMindsClub welcomes you among our family, whether to attend our Talk, Workhops, or to complete the Openfest challenges.<br/><br/>

Happy Hacking!

## What is Hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest is DigitalOcean‚Äôs annual event that encourages people to contribute to open source throughout October. Much of modern tech infrastructure‚Äîincluding some of DigitalOcean‚Äôs own products‚Äîrelies on open-source projects built and maintained by passionate people who often don‚Äôt have the staff or budgets to do much more than keep the project alive. Hacktoberfest is all about giving back to those projects, sharpening skills, and celebrating all things open source, especially the people that make open source so special.
<br>
For the past 10 years, thousands of people‚Äîcoders and non-coders alike‚Äîhave participated in Hacktoberfest to support the projects they use and love, learn and practice skills that will enhance their careers, and meet new people who love open source as much as they do.
